Demonstration Instructions

To setup a clean environment for the demo:

Overview
========

VPN to the pfsense box:
* 66.239.37.190
* james,jeff,teyo, etc...
* Setup DNS to use 192.168.100.1
* Setup DNS to search puppetlabs.lan

* Puppet is NOT installed into the systems.  Use envpuppet wrapper script
* The "special" domU tomcat0 is used as a reference for LVM snapshots.
* Do not boot tomcat0 unless you need to change the reference LVM disk.
* Do not remove the tomcat0 LVM block device. (/dev/VolGroup00/tomcat0)

* puppetmasterd and dashboard are running on hyel
* The VM Host (hypervisor) is running on gunab
* The VM instances are named tomcat{1,2,3,4} and have static MAC's in DHCP
* You should be able to log in as root or james,jeff on all hosts.
* sudo on all hosts is configured to operate w/o passwords and preserves PATH

Steps to ensure clean operation:

* Log into hyel and start screen as your own user
* Start puppet master: sudo envpuppet puppetmasterd --no-daemonize --verbose
* Start the dashboard:
** cd /opt/puppetlabs/puppet-dashboard
** sudo script/server -e production
* NOTE: The dashboard should be run as root for "Trigger puppet run!" button.
* Clean all VM certificates:
** for i in 1 2 3 4; do sudo envpuppet puppetca --clean tomcat${i}.puppetlabs.lan; done
* Log into the dashboard at http://hyel.puppetlabs.lan:3000/nodes/gunab.puppetlabs.lan
* Ensure there are no virtnode::tomcat* parameters on node gunab
** TIP: Change "virtnode::" to "virtnode_disable::" to disable it.
** These parameters add VM resources to gunab.  They must not be present when
we start puppetd in listen mode, or the VM's are created before the demo begins.

* Log into gunab as your own user
* Start GNU screen
* Start puppetd on gunab, this will be listening to trigger VM creation
** sudo envpuppet puppetd --no-daemonize --verbose --listen
** NOTE: Make sure virtnode::tomcat* parameters are removed from the node
in the dashboard before starting puppetd, or VM's will be created!
* Ensure no domU is running: sudo xm list
* If they are running, shutdown with: sudo virsh shutdown tomcatX
* Once domains are all shutdown, remove the LVM snapshots:
** sudo /usr/bin/demoreset
* Make sure certificates are clean on hyel one last time.

At this point, you're ready for the demo.

The demo:
DHCP is used.  Four entries are present:
00:16:36:45:21:D0 - tomcat1.puppetlabs.lan
00:16:36:45:21:D1 - tomcat2.puppetlabs.lan
00:16:36:45:21:D2 - tomcat3.puppetlabs.lan
00:16:36:45:21:D3 - tomcat4.puppetlabs.lan

* First, create a node for the VM (tomcat{1,2,3,4}) in the dashboard if not already present.
* Define parameters for the VM:
** virtnode::id => tomcat1
** virtnode::vm_mac => "00:16:36:45:21:D0" (NOTE MUST MATCH hostname!)
** virtnode::vm_uuid => "xxxx" (Use uuidgen on your mac)
** virtnode::type => "xen::vmachine" (Always use this.  Set in the group)

Once the VM node and parameters are created, associate the VM with the Hypervisor
* Open node gunab in the dashboard
* Add the parameter:
** virtnode::tomcat1 => tomcat1.puppetlabs.lan (FQDN, must match node name in the dashboard)
** NOTE: any number of 1..4 will work here, so long as the MAC address is set correctly for that node.

Once setup, trigger the VM creation:
* Click Trigger Puppet Run! on node gunab (Cross fingers...)
* Refresh reports until gunab reports it has created the VM.
* Refresh reports until the VM executes puppetd and checks in.
* Look at the reports to ensure Tomcat was properly managed.
* Browse to: http://tomcat1.puppetlabs.lan:8080/hudson/

NOTE: I've noticed tomcat doesn't always bind to port 8080 and wrote a wrapper
script to check if it's bound and restart the process if it's not.  Let me know
if it's still mis-behaving.

Profit!
