Before executing, take a snapshot if you're in a VM.
Java doesn't uninstall easily.

I developed and tested it with:
sudo envpuppet -v --modulepath /home/jeff/plabs \
  /home/jeff/plabs/puppetlabs-tomcat/manifests/site.pp

You get:
  Sun Java JDK (Java Runtime)
  Apache Tomcat 5 (The "Official" One, not vendored)
  Hudson Continuous Integration Web Application
